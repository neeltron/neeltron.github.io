Being an active undergraduate researcher, entrepreneur, and hacker, I always have to be ready to present my work. It could either be the next investor on call, a conference, a hackathon demonstration, or a university project. Something that they all have in common are presentation slides. If I were to spend all of my time summarizing my content and framing it up in slides, that'd take up a lot of time. So, I thought of making this tool last weekend to help students and researchers. TigerHacks was up around the corner and I knew what I wanted to build, fired away at my keyboard, and finished it up within 36 hours!<br>
