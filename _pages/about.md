I am a senior at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. As a researcher, engineer, and a passionate roboticist, I aspire to make the tech sphere more accessible for everyone.

As an ardent interdisciplinary researcher, I have covered various aspects of Mechanical, Electronics and Electrical, and Aerospace Engineering along with my major. The experience for my interdisciplinarity can be found in some of my <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/publications/">patents</a>, <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/competitions">competitions</a>, and <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/hackathons">hackathons</a>. This got me to work on my Computer-aided designing, PCB designing, programming, manufacturing, and especially management skills and increased my adaptibility to learn new things quickly.

Currently, I'm a Research Intern at Robotics Research Centre, <a href = "https://iiit.ac.in">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a>, advised by <a href = "https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/Harikumar/">Dr. Harikumar Kandath</a> and <a href = "https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/">Dr. K. Madhava Krishna</a>. My work includes building the prototype, developing, experimenting, and testing of algorithms for safe landing of unmanned aerial vehichles.

I'm passionate about participating in hackathons, and have attended the ones hosted by <a href = "https://mlh.io">Major League Hacking</a>, University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Boston University, Stony Brook University, etc., where I built projects like Brain controlled robotic joint, HearAssist (A tool that converts speech to text for the hearing impaired), SafeMail (An intelligent mailbox that identifies mail theft using facial recognition), etc., and Iâ€™m hoping to turn these projects into reality in the future.
