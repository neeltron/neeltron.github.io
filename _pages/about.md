Neel is a senior at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, currently pursuing his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. As a researcher, engineer, and a passionate roboticist, he aspires to make the tech sphere more accessible for everyone.

As an ardent interdisciplinary researcher, he has covered various aspects of Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical, and Aerospace Engineering along with his major. The experience for his interdisciplinarity can be found in some of his <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/publications/">patents</a>, <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/projects">projects</a>, and <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/competitions">competitions</a>. This got him to work on his Computer-aided designing, PCB designing, programming, manufacturing, and especially management skills and increased his adaptibility to learn new things quickly.

Currently, he is a Research Intern at Robotics Research Centre, <a href = "https://iiit.ac.in">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a>, advised by <a href = "https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/Harikumar/">Dr. Harikumar Kandath</a> and <a href = "https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/">Dr. K. Madhava Krishna</a>. His work includes prototyping, developing, experimenting, and testing the algorithms for Safe Landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehichles and implementation of Visual Servoing on an Aerial Manipulator.

Apart from this, he is also passionate about participating in <a href = "https://neeltron.github.io/projects">hackathons</a>, and has attended the ones hosted by <a href = "https://mlh.io">Major League Hacking</a>, University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Boston University, Stony Brook University, etc., where he built projects like Brain controlled robotic joint, HearAssist (A tool that converts speech to text for the hearing impaired), SafeMail (An intelligent mailbox that identifies mail theft using facial recognition), etc., and he is willing to turn these projects into reality in the future.
