      year: 2021
      description: Amputees face physical and emotional challenges in their day-to-day life, and their struggle is immeasurable. To solve this problem, I'm presenting a robotic joint, that can be used as a limb (once combined with prosthetics) and can help them control an artificial arm or leg using their brain. Although the headset contains only a single channel, it can still be a stepping stone to cutting-edge technology.

      year: 2022
      description: Character.io loads a new set of cartoon characters whenever the page is reloaded. If you don't like that set, just press the space bar and it'll load a new one for you! The algorithm behind character.io uses the power of generative adversarial networks, which are nothing but just two neural networks competing against each other. Where the generator would generate a character set, and the discriminator would evaluate if the character set is good or not. Both of them are trained against each other.
