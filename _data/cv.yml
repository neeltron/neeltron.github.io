      year: 2021
      description: Amputees face physical and emotional challenges in their day-to-day life, and their struggle is immeasurable. To solve this problem, I'm presenting a robotic joint, that can be used as a limb (once combined with prosthetics) and can help them control an artificial arm or leg using their brain. Although the headset contains only a single channel, it can still be a stepping stone to cutting-edge technology.

      description: PresentQuick is a tool that can convert a long article or research paper into a simple presentation, that makes it easier to understand. It uses NLP to analyze long pieces of content and recollects the most important sentences and breaks them down into slides. This web application can be used either for presenting something to the audience of even to get a simple understanding of a complex topic.

      year: 2022
      description: Character.io loads a new set of cartoon characters whenever the page is reloaded. If you don't like that set, just press the space bar and it'll load a new one for you! The algorithm behind character.io uses the power of generative adversarial networks, which are nothing but just two neural networks competing against each other. Where the generator would generate a character set, and the discriminator would evaluate if the character set is good or not. Both of them are trained against each other.
